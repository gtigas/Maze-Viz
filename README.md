# Maze-Viz
Maze-Viz will be both a maze-generating visualization as well as a maze-solving visualization. 

## MVP/Features
1. Visually pleasing visualization of generating a maze using a depth-first search algorithm (recursive backtracking)
2. Visually pleasing visualization of solving said maze using a depth-first search algorithm.
3. Visually pleasing visualization of solving said maze using a breadth-first search algorithm.

## Implementation Timeline
### Maze Generation (2 days)
- [ ] Setup project and filetree
- [ ] Create HTML Document with Canvas for rendering grid
- [ ] Write `Grid` class that will store all of the cells
- [ ] Write `Cell` class that stores position and relative information
- [ ] Write out algorithm that populates grid with cells.
- [ ] Animate the population of cells onto canvas.
- [ ] Create button to trigger maze generation

### Maze Solving (2 days)
- [ ] Write out DFS algorithm to solve maze.
- [ ] Write out BFS algorithm to solve maze.
- [ ] Animate the solving of the mazes.
- [ ] Make appropriate and visually appealing styling for grid/cells.
